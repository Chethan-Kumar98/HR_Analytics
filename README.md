This repository showcases a HR Analytics project focused on Attrition Analysis. The project aims to explore and analyze employee attrition data within an organization to understand the factors influencing employee turnover. By leveraging the power of Power BI, this project visualizes key human resource metrics and provides actionable insights to help organizations reduce attrition and improve employee retention.

Project Overview:

Data Source:
The dataset includes comprehensive employee details and attrition-related information, such as age, salary, job role, education level, gender, tenure, and performance ratings.

Objective:
To analyze employee attrition patterns, calculate key performance indicators (KPIs), and visualize the relationship between various demographic factors and employee turnover.

Key Features and Dashboards:

Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

1. Total Employees: Displays the total number of employees in the organization.
2. Total Attrition: Tracks the total number of employees who have left the organization.
3. Attrition Rate: Shows the percentage of employees who have left relative to the total workforce.
4. Average Age: Provides insights into the average age of employees in the organization.
5. Average Salary: Analyzes the average salary distribution across the workforce.
6. Active Employees: Displays the current count of employees still active in the organization.

Attrition Insights by Demographics:

1. Attrition by Age: Visualizes attrition trends based on employee age groups, helping to understand if specific age groups are more prone to leaving.
2. Attrition by Salary: Analyzes the relationship between salary levels and employee turnover.
3. Attrition by Job Role: Examines how different job roles contribute to overall attrition rates.
4. Attrition by Education: Explores how education level influences employee attrition.
5. Attrition by Gender: Compares attrition rates across male and female employees.

Data-Driven Decision-Making:
The dashboard helps HR teams and leadership understand attrition trends, identify potential risk factors, and make data-driven decisions to improve employee retention and engagement strategies.

Tools & Technologies:
1. Power BI: Used for creating interactive dashboards and data visualizations.
2. Data Transformation: Leveraged Power Query Editor for cleaning, transforming, and preparing the data.
3. DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Utilized for calculating measures like attrition rate and average employee metrics.

Business Impact:
This project enables organizations to gain deeper insights into the root causes of employee attrition. By identifying key drivers such as salary, job role, and age, businesses can create targeted retention strategies, improve employee satisfaction, and reduce turnover costs. The interactive dashboard provides real-time monitoring of attrition trends, empowering HR teams to take proactive steps to address workforce challenges.
